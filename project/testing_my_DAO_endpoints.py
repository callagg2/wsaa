# To test the create_route() function, we can run the following code:
route = routeDAO.create_route(route)
routeid = route["id"] # this is the id of the newly created route record, which we can use to test the other functions that require an id as an argument




# To test the get_all_routes() function, we can run the following code:
routes = routeDAO.get_all_routes()
print(f"\ntest get all routes:", routes) # returns a list of dict objects, each dict represents a route record in the database, 
#with the keys being the column names and the values being the corresponding values for that record.




# To test the find_route_by_id() function, we can run the following code:
result= routeDAO.find_route_by_id(routeid)
print(f"\ntest create and find by id:", route) # returns a dict object representing the route record with the specified id in the routeid = route["id"] above, 
# with the keys being the column names and the values being the corresponding values for that record.



# To test the update_route() function, we can run the following code:
updated_route = {   
    "destination": "updated test",
    "route_map": "some other map",
    "distance": 456,
    "elevation": 789
    }            
result = routeDAO.update_route(routeid, updated_route)
original_route = result[1] # we can return the route before it was updated
#print(f"\ntest update route: 1 record updated, ID: {routeid}, Destination: {result['destination']}, Route Map: {result['route_map']}, Distance: {result['distance']}, Elevation: {result['elevation']}", result) 
# # returns a dict object representing the updated route record, with the keys being the column names and the values being the corresponding values for that record. 
# The id key will still be the same as the original route, but the other keys will have the updated values.
print(f"\ntest update route: 1 record updated", "\noriginal route:", original_route, "\nupdated route:", result[0]) # returns a dict object representing the updated route record, 
#with the keys being the column names and the values being the corresponding values for that record. 
#The id key will still be the same as the original route, but the other keys will have the updated values.




# To test the delete_route() function, we can run the following code:
result = routeDAO.delete_route(routeid)
route_to_be_deleted= result[1] # we can return the route that was just deleted, so that we can see what was deleted in the test output
print(f"\ntest delete route: 1 record deleted", route_to_be_deleted, ", Deleted:", result[0]) # returns a boolean value indicating whether the delete operation was successful or not. 
#If the route with the specified id was successfully deleted, it will return True, otherwise it will return False.
